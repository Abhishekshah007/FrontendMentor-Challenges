# FrontendMentor-Challenges

Every site is hosted on GitHub Pages. To access the live demo, simply follow this format: BASE_URI/[specific_challenge_folder_name]/. If the folder contains an 'index' file, it will automatically serve as the entry point. However, if the folder contains other files as the entry point, you will need to specify the specific entry point.

BASE_URI: https://abhishekshah007.github.io/FrontendMentor-Challenges/

For example: https://abhishekshah007.github.io/FrontendMentor-Challenges/qr-code-component-main/
