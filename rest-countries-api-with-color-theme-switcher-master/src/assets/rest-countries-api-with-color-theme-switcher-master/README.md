# REST Countries API with Color Theme Switcher

## Overview

Welcome to the REST Countries API challenge! In this project, I integrated with the REST Countries API to pull country data and display it following the provided designs. This project allows users to explore countries, search for specific countries, filter them by region, view detailed country information, and toggle between light and dark color themes.

### The Challenge

The challenge was to build a responsive web application that fetches and displays data from the REST Countries API. Users should have the following capabilities:
- View all countries on the homepage
- Search for a country using an input field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see detailed information on a separate page
- Navigate to bordering countries from the detail page
- Toggle between light and dark color themes (optional)
